ABSTRACT = {With the ubiquitous use of digital technologies and the consequent data deluge, official statistics faces new challenges and opportunities. In this context, strengthening official statistics through effective data governance will be crucial to ensure reliability, quality, and access to data. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for digital data governance for official statistics, addressing key components, such as data collection and management, processing and analysis, data sharing and dissemination, as well as privacy and ethical considerations. The framework integrates principles of data governance into digital statistical processes, enabling statistical organizations to navigate the complexities of the digital environment. Drawing on case studies and best practices, the paper highlights successful implementations of digital data governance in official statistics. The paper concludes by discussing future trends and directions, including emerging technologies and opportunities for advancing digital data governance.},

abstract = { Multiple crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic and increased
 frequency and intensity of disasters related to climate change, have demonstrated
 the critical importance of timely and open access to trusted data.
 Open data principles and practices that facilitate data access and use,
 relevance to policy needs, and increase the impact and value of data are central
 to building trust in data. The paper outlines four trends that present opportunities
 for expanding adoption and use of open data principles and practices and building data trust:
 the modernization of data governance; increased attention to the role of citizens in
 building trust and increasing the relevance of data and citizens’ contribution
 to data throughout the data value chain; the adoption of open data principles;
 and the work of watchdog organizations monitoring the progress of countries
 and agencies and identifying areas of data governance that still need attention. }

abstract = { It is easy to feel that official statistics faces unprecedented challenges in being a trusted voice for evidence. Official statistics are released into a foggy and polluted atmosphere full of dodgy data within a political climate where people all too readily cloak their vested interests in a fake veneer of statistical claims. This paper explores some enduring aspects of the way we as human beings interact with numbers and gives an historical perspective on how this has played out in official statistics. It explores some particular features of the challenges faced today given this context, especially in relation to capacity building. It highlights the essential role of the National Statistical Institute as a trustworthy servant of democracy at the heart of the evolving data ecosystem and explains why this matters. It voices a call to action for all those who care about the use of evidence in the public sphere, both those who deliver the statistical services and those who use them. }

abstract = { Drawing on recent work to develop the United Nations
 National Quality Assurance Frameworks Manual for Official Statistics to
 respond to the new data ecosystem, this paper addresses three important
 questions now facing the statistical community: (1) How can official statistics
 assure the quality of data from administrative and other sources? (2) Can the
 quality assurance framework for official statistics be applied to data as
 opposed to statistics? (3) What other implications does the difference
 between data and statistics have for the role of official statistics in the
 new data ecosystem? The paper argues that statistical offices should strongly
 support the establishment of national data stewards but should not take on
 such a role themselves. Mixing responsibilities for data and official statistics
 risks both undermining official statistics and not doing justice to the need
 to develop data as an asset in a responsible way. }
