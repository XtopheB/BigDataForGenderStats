abstract = {Animations are commonplace in today's user interfaces. From bouncing icons that catch attention, to transitions helping with orientation, to tutorials, animations can serve numerous purposes. We revisit Baecker and Small's pioneering work Animation at the Interface, 25 years later. We reviewed academic publications and commercial systems, and interviewed 20 professionals of various backgrounds. Our insights led to an expanded set of roles played by animation in interfaces today for keeping in context, teaching, improving user experience, data encoding and visual discourse. We illustrate each role with examples from practice and research, discuss evaluation methods and point to opportunities for future research. This expanded description of roles aims at inspiring the HCI research community to find novel uses of animation, guide them towards evaluation and spark further research.},

Within the kirigami possibilities, we investigate how different aspects of cutting patterns offer opportunities for mapping data to both independent and dependent physical variables. As a first step towards understanding the data physicalization opportunities in KiriPhys, we conducted a qualitative study in which 12 participants interacted with four KiriPhys examples. Our observations of how people interact with, understand, and respond to KiriPhys suggest that KiriPhys: 1) provides new opportunities for interactive, layered data exploration, 2) introduces elastic expansion as a new sensation that can reveal data, and 3) offers data mapping possibilities while providing a pleasurable experience that stimulates curiosity and engagement.},

Both papers by Farrell emphasised the importance of graphical visualisation of non-parametric frontier functions, but, to our knowledge, this is seldom followed up in the literature. We use a graphical package (EffiVision) with a numerical representation of the frontier functions, representing the contemporary development of visualisation. By making suitable cuts through the DEA frontier in multidimensional space, various graphical representations of features of economic interest can be done. Development of ray average cost function and scale elasticity are novel illustrations.},

abstract = { Effectively designed data visualizations allow viewers to use their
powerful visual systems to understand patterns in data across science, education,
health, and public policy. But ineffectively designed visualizations can cause confusion,
misunderstanding, or even distrust—especially among viewers with low graphical literacy.
We review research-backed guidelines for creating effective and intuitive visualizations
oriented toward communicating data to students, coworkers, and the general public.
We describe how the visual system can quickly extract broad statistics from a display,
whereas poorly designed displays can lead to misperceptions and illusions. Extracting
global statistics is fast, but comparing between subsets of values is slow.
Effective graphics avoid taxing working memory, guide attention, and respect familiar conventions.
Data visualizations can play a critical role in teaching and communication,
provided that designers tailor those visualizations to their audience. }

La visualisation de l'information par des méthodes graphiques lorsqu'elle s'appuie sur les Nouvelles Technologies de l'Information et de la Communication, apparaît comme une voie prometteuse vers une meilleure compréhension des concepts abstraits de la Statistique.Notre propos est axé sur l'aspect visuel des tableaux croisés représentés par des diagrammes en mosaïque. Après avoir replacé les graphiques en Statistique, nous présentons sur un exemple les tableaux croisés à double entrée. Cet exemple nous permet d'introduire le vocabulaire et les différents éléments statistiques, effectifs, probabilités marginales, probabilités conditionnelles, repérables sur un tableau croisé.Nous montrons l'apport selon les situations, des représentations visuelles offertes par les diagrammes en barres, les diagrammes en bandes et les diagrammes en mosaïque. Nous terminons sur les prolongements en cours de développement autour des diagrammes en mosaïque, et les logiciels interactifs.

    abstract = { How is undocumented migration typically mapped in contemporary cartography? To answer this question, we conduct an iconological dissection of what could be seen as the epitome of the cartography on undocumented migration, the map made by Frontex – the EU’s border agency. We find that, rather than a scientific depiction of a migratory phenomenon, its cartography peddles a crude distortion of undocumented migration that smoothly splices into the xenophobic tradition of propaganda cartography – and stands in full confrontation with contemporary geographical scholarship. We conclude with an urgent appeal for more scientifically robust, critical and decidedly more creative cartographies of migration. }

abstract = {If visualization is to be democratized, we need to provide means for non-experts to create visualizations that allow them to engage directly with datasets. We present constructive visualization a new paradigm for the simple creation of flexible, dynamic visualizations. Constructive visualization is simple-in that the skills required to build and manipulate the visualizations are akin to kindergarten play; it is expressive in that one can build within the constraints of the chosen environment, and it also supports dynamics -- in that these constructed visualizations can be rebuilt and adjusted. We de- scribe the conceptual components and processes underlying constructive visualization, and present real-world examples to illustrate the utility of this approach. The constructive visualization approach builds on our inherent understanding and experience with physical building blocks, offering a model that enables non-experts to create entirely novel visualizations, and to engage with datasets in a manner that would not have otherwise been possible.},

DualScale charts incorporate two different data resolutions into one chart in order to emphasize data in regions of interest or to enable the comparison of data from distant regions. While some design guidelines exist for these types of charts, there is currently little empirical evidence on which to base their design. We ﬁll this gap by discussing the design space of Dual-Scale cartesian-coordinate charts and by experimentally comparing the performance of different chart types with respect to elementary graphical perception tasks such as comparing lengths and distances. Our study suggests that cut-out charts which include collocated full context and focus are the best alternative, and that superimposed charts in which focus and context overlap on top of each other should be avoided.},

Plots of this type can accommodate numerical data as well as ordered or unordered categorical data, or a mixture of these different data types. Knots and parallel wefts are features of the textile plot which greatly aid the interpretation of the data. Several practical examples are presented which illustrate the potential usefulness of the textile plot as an aid to the interpretation of multivariate data. },

 abstract = {Analogical reasoning is a core cognitive skill that distinguishes humans from all other species and contributes to general fluid intelligence, creativity, and adaptive learning capacities. Yet its origins are not well understood. In the study reported here, we analyzed large-scale longitudinal data from the Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development to test predictors of growth in analogical-reasoning skill from third grade to adolescence. Our results suggest an integrative resolution to the theoretical debate regarding contributory factors arising from smaller-scale, cross-sectional experiments on analogy development. Children with greater executive-function skills (both composite and inhibitory control) and vocabulary knowledge in early elementary school displayed higher scores on a verbal analogies task at age 15 years, even after adjusting for key covariates. We posit that knowledge is a prerequisite to analogy performance, but strong executive-functioning resources during early childhood are related to long-term gains in fundamental reasoning skills.},

From a historical perspective, this article reviews different categorisations of data uncertainty, specifically the traditional typology that distinguishes sampling from nonsampling errors and a newer typology of Manski (2015). Throughout, the importance of measuring and communicating these uncertainties is emphasised, as hard as it can prove to measure some sources of data uncertainty, especially those relevant to administrative and big data sets. Accordingly, this article both seeks to encourage further work into the measurement and communication of data uncertainty in general and to introduce the Comunikos (COMmunicating UNcertainty In Key Official Statistics) project at Eurostat. Comunikos is designed to evaluate alternative ways of measuring and communicating data uncertainty specifically in contexts relevant to official economic statistics.},

We start with an in-depth analysis of what deception means in the context of data visualization, and categorize deceptive visualizations based on the type of deception they lead to. We identify popular distortion techniques and the type of visualizations those distortions can be applied to, and formalize why deception occurs with those distortions. We create four deceptive visualizations using the selected distortion techniques, and run a crowdsourced user study to identify the deceptiveness of those visualizations. We then present the findings of our study and show how deceptive each of these visual distortion techniques are, and for what kind of questions the misinterpretation occurs. We also analyze individual differences among participants and present the effect of some of those variables on participants' responses. This paper presents a first step in empirically studying deceptive visualizations, and will pave the way for more research in this direction.},

The best known thematic map type is the choropleth, in which regions are colored according to the distribution of a data variable. The R package tmap offers a coherent plotting system for thematic maps that is based on the layered grammar of graphics. Thematic maps are created by stacking layers, where per layer, data can be mapped to one or more aesthetics. It is also possible to generate small multiples. Thematic maps can be further embellished by configuring the map layout and by adding map attributes, such as a scale bar and a compass. Besides plotting thematic maps on the graphics device, they can also be made interactive as an HTML widget. In addition, the R package tmaptools contains several convenient functions for reading and processing spatial data.},

 doi={10.18637/jss.v059.i10},

 abstract={A huge amount of effort is spent cleaning data to get it ready for
  analysis, but there has been little research on how to make data cleaning
  as easy and effective as possible. This paper tackles a small, but important,
  component of data cleaning: data tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to
  manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure:
  each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of
  observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy
  datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide
  range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop
  tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets.
  The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated
  with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.}
